# Final-Year-Project

The Virtual Wardrobe and Shopping Assistant project aims to revolutionize the way users manage their fashion choices. This mobile app integrates advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) to offer personalized outfit recommendations and virtual try-ons. Users can digitally organize their wardrobe, explore AI-generated designs for custom clothing, and locate nearby stores.
